One obstacle that I overcame was checking to see if the student status wasn’t a “y” or “n.” I read it in English as “not y or n,” so I used “if (studentStatus != "y" || studentStatus != "n"),” but even if a student inputs y which is correct, y != n, so the if statement would be true and give the error message. I eventually correctly changed the or (||) to an and (&&). Another obstacle I encountered was understanding the small details in the directions, especially the rules for calculating fare price. For the instructions, “For trips crossing 0 or 1 zone boundaries, students 18 or over get the same break as riders under 18,” I thought that meant everyone crossing 0 or 1 boundaries paid $0.65, but I finally realized it said “students” after a while and had to change my code to reflect that. Additionally, I used “cin >>” to retrieve string values at first, and it didn’t work for destinations such as “Las Vegas.” I realized “cin >>” was only taking the first word, and I remembered that getline(cin, variable name) is better to use for strings. Plus, I declared fare as an int at first, but I caught the error when I realized the fare prices were being truncated to whole numbers.b. the input will be formatted as follows: (age, student status (y/n), destination, number of zone boundaries crossed)A negative age: (-23, y, Hawaii, 3)Student status other than y or n: (12, s, Westwood, 2)Nothing provided for destination: (64, n, “”, 0)Negative number of zone boundaries crossed: (29, y, Venice Beach, -9)Rider under 18 crossing 0 or 1 boundaries (discount - $0.65): (17, n, Los Angeles, 1)Student 18 or over crossing 0 or 1 boundaries (discount - $0.65): (19, y, Las Vegas, 0)Senior (65+) (not student) crossing at least 1 boundary (discount - $0.55 + $0.25 * numBoundariesCrossed): (80, n, Anaheim, 5)Senior (not student) crossing zero boundaries (discount - $0.45): (67, n, Santa Monica, 0)Senior student crossing 1 boundary (student discount): (99, y, Palm Springs, 1)Normal input with no discount applied: (25, n, Yorba Linda, 4)No discount with no boundaries crossed: (19, n, Oakland, 0)All input errors to assure it displays the error message for the earliest error: (-3, yesno, “”, -5)Oldest person to not receive the senior discount: (64, n, Detroit, 0)Youngest person to not receive minor discount (18, n, Orange, 1)
